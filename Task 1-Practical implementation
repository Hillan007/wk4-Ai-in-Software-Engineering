Python Function to Sort a List of Dictionaries by a Specific Key

##Here’s an AI-suggested implementation using Python’s built-in sorted() function:
from operator import itemgetter

 def sort_dicts_by_key(data, key):
    return sorted(data, key=itemgetter(key))


##Manual Implementation
A manual approach using a lambda function:
def sort_dicts_by_key_manual(data, key):
    return sorted(data, key=lambda x: x[key])


##Efficiency Comparison
Both implementations achieve the same result, but the AI-suggested version using itemgetter() is slightly more efficient.
- Performance: itemgetter() is optimized at the C level, making it marginally faster than a lambda function.
- Readability: The AI-suggested version is more concise and avoids unnecessary function calls.
- Flexibility: Both methods work for sorting dictionaries, but itemgetter() is preferable when sorting large datasets.
